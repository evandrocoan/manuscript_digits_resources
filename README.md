# Manuscript Digits Resources


Contains binary data for digits recognition, for the:

> ### Practical Work 5 - The Identification of Digits Manuscripts

> Pattern recognition is the process of training a neural network to assign a correct class to a set of input patterns. Once trained, the network can be used to sort patterns that you have not seen before.
 
> In this work, a set of data should be used to train and test a neural network, which classifies handwritten digits. Data for training, validation and testing were obtained from a subset of MNIST database data.

> The input parameters for the network are values ​​of each pixel, assuming that the numbers were previously normalized and centered and placed in a 20x20 matrix (400 pixels in gray scales).

> And the output is the correct value of the digit, the digit 0 being the value 10.

> Data files can be obtained in OCTAVE / MATLAB (.mat) or CSV (.csv) format. In csv each column has a digit pattern and the last row is the digit classification.

> This exercise can be done in any language / environment, but if it is done in OCTAVE / MATLAB, a function called displayData has been made available that makes it easy to see the digits.

> In addition to demonstrating the functioning neural network, a complete Report should be submitted, containing information such as: How the data were standardized; How the training and test set was separated; How much data was used for training and how many for testing; What network architecture is used; How many experiments were done until arriving at the final result; How was the training; What is the rate of correctness of the network; The matrix of confusion, etc ...
